Study the routine at 0x1FB9.

Label 0x4080, screen address used to store a routine copied from the
ROM (0x2A41).

Study table at 0x31C8.

Study code at 0x22C4.
	
Study meaning of literals (file types?) in:

- `ld (hl),044h  ;22d8 36 44  6 D`
- `ld (hl),043h  ;2b0e 36 43  6 C`

Three bytes at 0x2FF0 are disassembled as data, but they are code
(`ldir / ret`). This seems a bug of z80dasm.
