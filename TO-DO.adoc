Study the routine at 0x1FB9.

.2016-09-02:

Label 0x4080, screen address used to store a routine copied from the
ROM (0x2A41).

.2016-09-02:

Study table at 0x31C8.

.2016-09-02:

Study code at 0x22C4.
	
.2016-09-02:

Study meaning of literals (file types?) in:

- `ld (hl),044h  ;22d8 36 44  6 D`
- `ld (hl),043h  ;2b0e 36 43  6 C`

Three bytes at 0x2FF0 are disassembled as data, but they are code
(`ldir / ret`). This seems a bug of z80dasm.

.2016-09-02:

z80dasm's bug? This block causes addresses 0x31FA..0x31FC
be interpreted as bytedata, in one single line:
`not_used_31FD: start 0x31FD unlabeled last 0x3CF9 type bytedata`.

This does not solve the problem:
`code_31FA_XXX_FIXME: start 0x31FA unlabeled last 0x31FC type code`.

It seems there's a typo in the ROM:
